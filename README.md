# Vehicle Motion Prediction
Vehicle Motion Prediction using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. This project was done as a part of the course CS 229: Machine Learning at Stanford University by Lovisa Byman, Emil Vardar and Eden Wang.


The goal with the project is to predict the trajectory of 8 objects (vehicles, cyclists or pedestrians) up to 8 seconds into the future using 1 second of past context. The dataset used in this project is the Waymo open dataset [1].
